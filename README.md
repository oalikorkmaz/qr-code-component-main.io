## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

If you are going to use padding for an image in bootstrap, first create a div and put the image in that div and apply padding like that.
For Example:

```html
 <div class=" p-3">
      <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" class="card-img-top rounded-4 " alt="qr-code">
    </div>
```

### Continued development

In the future, I will learn the backend parts and try to become a fullstack. This is just the beginning :)

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - Bootstrap gave me convenience in html and css parts.
